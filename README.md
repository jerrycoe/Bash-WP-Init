# Bash-WP-Init

## What this does
1. Downloads latest stable release of Wordpress
2. Downloads boilerplate blank theme from my repo to themes directory
3. Initializes a new git repo for blank theme
4. Makes API call to Github to create new remote repo
5. Pushes theme to new repo
6. Creates new MySQL database
7. Creates new host in /etc/hosts
8. Creates new virtual host in /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
9. Restarts apache2
10. Opens new local website in browser
</br>
<p>This automates the process of creating a new local Wordpress Installation and theme git repo for development.</p>
<p>My first bash script.</p>
